Upgrading to PactNet 5.x
========================

PactNet 5.x contains some breaking changes to improve the ergonomics of working with the new capabilities of Pact
Specification v4.

Combined Pacts
--------------

See: [RFC 457](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/issues/457)

In Pact Specification v3, the concept of asynchronous messaging pacts was introduced and support was added in PactNet 4.x
for this feature. This allowed for interactions to be defined in which two components communicated asynchronously, typically
through a message broker.

One key limitation of messaging support in v3 is that a Pact file can only contain either HTTP interactions or messaging
interactions, but not both. This was awkward to deal with in practice, because if a single component performed some HTTP
and some messaging interactions with another component, from the perspective of Pact these had to be treated as if they
were two separate components (e.g. an "Orders API" and an "Orders Messaging" consumer).

This artificial separation creates further problems - e.g. two separate verifications must be performed and two checks for
'Can I Deploy?' would be required when deploying one single provider.

In Pact Specification v4 this limitation has been lifted. The same Pact file can now contain both HTTP and messaging
interactions, and so the verifier needs to be changed so that it can be configured to verify both.

In [RFC 457](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/issues/457) this change was proposed such that the verifier could
configure both a HTTP endpoint and a messaging endpoint (or 'transport' as the FFI internals call them).

This breaking change means that instead of this:

```csharp
// HTTP style
var httpVerifier = new PactVerifier();
httpVerifier.ServiceProvider("My API", new Uri("http://localhost:5000"))
            .WithFileSource(...)
            .Verify();;

// Messaging style
var messageVerifier = new PactVerifier();
messageVerifier.MessagingProvider("My Messaging")
               .WithProviderMessages(scenarios => { ... })
               .WithFileSource(...)
               .Verify();;
```

You can now verify both with a single verifier:

```csharp
var verifier = new PactVerifier("My API");

verifier
    .WithHttpEndpoint(new Uri("http://localhost:5000"))
    .WithMessages(scenarios =>
    {
        scenarios.Add<MyEvent>("an event happens")
    })
    .WithFileSource(new FileInfo(@"..."))
    .Verify();
```
